# Contributing to HungerGames

## Golden Rules:

- Keep any/all NMS/Reflection related code to an absolute minimum.
- Do not copy/paste code from other sources.
  All code should be written by you and adhere to our [license](https://github.com/ShaneBeeStudios/HungerGames/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Before:
Before taking the time to make a big change and submitting a PR, we recommend posting a suggestion on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ShaneBeeStudios/HungerGames/issues) outlining what you'd like to do. This way the team can discuss with you whether or not we want this in HungerGames.

## DOs:
- PRs should be code based
- Code changes/additions should follow the style of HungerGames and not conventions Skript has set.

## DON'Ts:
- We won't accept PRs that are just string based changes. Your PR contribution should be code based. (If you find a typo, report it and/or let one of the team members know.)
- If a class seems outdated (in terms of formatting) please do not reformat the entire class for small changes (it makes PRs really difficult to read).
- Don't break any current syntaxes (ie: removing/changing a pattern with a breaking change).

## Branches:
- Bug fix PRs should be aimed towards the `dev/patch` branch.
- New feature/major change PRs should be aimed towards the `dev/feature` branch.

Changes will be made on these branches and later merged to `master` just before a release.
If a branch is currently missing please let me know.
